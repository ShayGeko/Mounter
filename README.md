## Workflow

- Let's try to use *gitmoji* in commit messages. Add them in commit messages as specified [here](https://gitmoji.dev/)
- New commits are to be added in the branch (***no pushes to master***), after which a merge request is to be created.
- For new features merge request should always have at least one reviewer other than the developer of said feature.
